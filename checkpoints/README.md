3 Checkpoints for this project requiring a submission for each to get full credit for the project. The checkpoints are as follows:

• (10 pts of final grade) Explanation of you idea - Due Monday, April 15 by 3pm. This is
a one-page description of what you plan to do, including a rough idea of your statistic,
what data you plan to use, and how you’ll present the statistic. I’ll read these quickly, I
promise, and give you feedback. You should also include whether you are working alone
or as a pair.

• (80 pts of final grade) Code and data - Due Friday, April 26 by 3pm. By this data, you
should have an almost complete code base and data set. You will need to submit a web
link that I can access to check your progress.

• (10 pts of final grade) Final product - Due Wednesday, May 1 by 3pm. This is the final
writeup, working code, data, and video for your project. This is the last day of class.
If anyone wants to present their work to the class, I will give you up to 5pts of extra
credit.
